# Overview

{ Our team is trying to create a calculator that can be used by everyone with additional features that "normal" calculators don't have.  }

{ We created a calculator that is able to calculate basic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division as well as trig functions such as sin, cos, tan, and log. We decided to spice it up by adding a tithing feature, and functions to calculate the tip and discount prices. Lastly, we were able to add a typing feature (not to the gui just to the terminal) where the user can type math problems where the order of operations applies. }

{ The purpose of this software is to allow users to execute every day math problems as well as help with calculations that they may not remember how to do.  }


# Development Environment

{ We developed this calculator using C++ and the library wxwidgets for the graphical user interface. }

{ List of libraries included to the project: }
-#include <wx/wx.h>
-#include <wx/grid.h>
-#include <wx/textctrl.h>
-#include <wx/sizer.h>
-#include <stack>
-#include <string>
-#include <sstream>
-#include <cmath>
-#include <cctype>
-#include <stdexcept>
-#include <iostream>
-#include <map>
-#include <vector>
